            <h3>Where is my confirmation email?</h3>
            <p>We automatically send you a confirmation email with your order details and estimated delivery times once you completed the checkout process. If you didn't receive one, please do not worry. You can try these instead:</p>

Only (1) coupon per order can be applied. </p>
            <h3>How long does it take for my order to arrive?</h3>
            <p>All items are subject to a handling period before they are dispatched. Most of our items leave the warehouse within 2-7 business days of payment.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>USA Orders:</strong> Delivery typically takes 2-4 weeks after an item ships.</li>
            <li><strong>International Orders:</strong> Delivery typically takes 4-6 weeks after an item ships, sometimes faster.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some cases, international shipping can take up to 8 weeks. Due to factors that often affect international shipments, such as holidays, weather conditions, natural disasters or customs, we can only offer an estimate of shipping times. While most packages arrive on time, there may be circumstances and delays that carriers may experience. In most cases, orders arrive before the allotted time frame. Your patience is truly appreciated.</p>
            <h3>Can I make changes to my order?</h3>
            <p>We process orders the same day they are placed. If you wish to make any changes to your order, you may do so up until the time that your order has been processed. Please contact us immediately at: <strong>support @ hyperjourney.com</strong> and we will do our best to accommodate changes for you, but we cannot make any promises. Once your order has been processed and forwarded to our fulfillment center, we no longer have the ability to make changes the order.</p>

            <h3>I ordered multiple items but only part of my order arrived. Why?</h3>
            <p>We do our best to reduce costs on your end so you don't have to pay high taxes on your items.</p>
            <p>We have a large assortment of products and source them from all over the globe to get the best quality at the best price.</p>
            <p>For logistical reasons, items in the same purchase will sometimes be sent in separate packages with no additional shipping charges. You may receive multiple packages on different days. Please keep this in mind when receiving deliveries.</p>
            <h3>Where are your products from?</h3>
            <p>Although our headquarters are located in the USA, all of our current suppliers are located in China. We ship directly from our factory to save our customers additional shipping + packaging costs.</p>
            <h3>Double Billing</h3>
            <p>If you ordered one item only and it's double billed, please send us your order number and a screenshot of your charge to review so we can issue a refund.</p>
            <h3>Shipping Policy</h3>
            <p>Hyper Journey is not responsible for destination country tax and/or any duty charge that may incur. Customers will be held accountable for any restrictions, duties, taxes, and any other fees collected from the destination country.</p>
            <p>Hyper Journey will not be responsible for any duties, taxes, or customs fees under any circumstances.</p>
            <p>If the order arrives at your country and the customer refuses to accept the package OR no attempt is made in the country of destination to deliver the package, Hyper Journey reserves the right to abandon the package(s) and will not be responsible for any refunds.</p>
            <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
            <p>We firmly stand behind all of our products. We will provide a full refund or replacement if you did not receive your order or if your order arrived damaged. Please find specific details on our Refund &amp; Return Policy page.</p>
            <h3>How secure is my personal information?</h3>
            <p>Hyper Journey store adheres to highest industry standards to protect your personal information when you checkout and purchase from our online store.</p>
            <p>Your credit card information is encrypted during transmission using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, which is widely used on the Internet for processing payments. Your credit card information is only used to complete the requested transaction and is not subsequently stored.</p>
            <h3>What are the washing instructions?</h3>
            <p>Most of our clothing can be machine washed in a light cold cycle. We find they wash best when turned inside out. Certain items with tassels, rhinestones, lace, etc. should be hand washed and hung or laid flat to dry. We also recommend knitted items to be hand washed as well.</p>
            <h3>Questions? Concerns? Suggestions?</h3>
